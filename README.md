# ArabicQuiz

this is the first app I created based on learning classical arabic pronounciation of words. I included a short 2-3 minute video lesson which then after the user can attempt a quiz to see how well they have done. Once they finish the quiz the user can share his score. 

Rather than explaining it I thought I would show it in action. Would love it if you can spare 2 minutes to watch the video on this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EHK4GsEOBVOSli39hAuiMsjKExxwic3c/view?usp=sharing
let me know what you think!!



Really enjoyed making it !!!!
